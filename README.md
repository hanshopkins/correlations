# correlations

Usage: Run setup_cpu.py to compile the c files using `python3 -c 'from setup_cpu import build; build()'`

The classes for importing baseband data are in baseband_data_classes.py.

Use the unpacked version of the class as the argument for average_cross_correlations in correlations.py to find the average. The second argument is the chunk size, or the bin size.
